/*
Finding the mother vertex of a graph. A mother vertex is such that starting a graph traversal with that vertex, one
can visit all the vertices of the graph.
The following approach does the following by performing a DFS and noting the last visited vertex. Then another DFS is
performed and checked whether all vertices are visited or not.
