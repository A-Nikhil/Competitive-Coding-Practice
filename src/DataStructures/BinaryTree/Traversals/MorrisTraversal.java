/*
Morris Traversal

Using Morris Traversal, we can traverse the tree without using stack and recursion.
The idea of Morris Traversal is based on Threaded Binary Tree.
In this traversal, we first create links to Inorder successor and print the data using these links,
and finally revert the changes to restore original tree.

1. Initialize current as root
2. While current is not NULL
   If the current does not have left child
      a) Print currentâ€™s data
      b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
   Else
      a) Make current as the right child of the rightmost
         node in current's left subtree
      b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
